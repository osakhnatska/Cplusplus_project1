1) Namespace is a region where we declare identifiers such as functions, variables etc. It is used to organize
code and avoid naming conflict.
2) Header files are files were we declare our functions, so that we can use it in multiple source files.
3) We never compile header files because they are included in our source files.
4) If we include one cpp file in other cpp file it defeats the purpose of modular programming and it also 
increases compile time.
5) I learned how to use namespaces, how to add safeguards to code modules to prevent multiple 
includes and why do we need it, how to divide your code in different modules.
